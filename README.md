# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains a minimal portfolio website scaffold (HTML, CSS, JS).

Files
- `index.html` — semantic outline with sections: header, hero, about, projects, skills, contact, footer.
- `style.css` — baseline styles and responsive layout.
- `script.js` — mobile nav toggle, smooth scrolling, and a placeholder contact form handler.
